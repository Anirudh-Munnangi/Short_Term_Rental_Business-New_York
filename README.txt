FOLDER INFORMATION:
1. Documentation Folder:
    This folder has the complete documentation in the form of a website based tool. To access it click on the file named "VisualNarrative.html". From there all the documentation should be self explanatory.

    Once the VisualNarrative.html file is open, there will be option to choose one of the three topics:

    A) Data Munging- This is where the details performed in the data munging step are documented. They are numbered in sequence and it is expected that the user will follow the sequence for better understanding.

    B) Data Quality Analysis- This is where the details related to data quality analysis topic are documented. They are numbered in sequence to make it easy for the user to follow. Each sub-topic can have many sub-charts with different inferences. The user must click on individual tabs to learn about the individual charts and the story conveyed by them.

    C) Data Analysis and Visualizations- This is where the complete visual narrative of the charts and visualizations is present. It is expected that the user will follow the sequence and follow similar instructions to that of data quality analysis. Each sub topic is an integral part in the discussion and must be analyzed together with others in order to reach to a final concrete conclusion.
